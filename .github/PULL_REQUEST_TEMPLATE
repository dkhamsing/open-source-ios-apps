Thanks for contributing to `open-source-ios-apps` 😊

When making an addition:
1. Insert the project in alphabetical order
2. Avoid iOS or open-source in description as it is assumed :-)
3. Use the commit title format if applicable: Add app-name by @github-username
4. Follow the following template (use 🔶 for Swift projects)

- App name: Short description 🔶
  - source url, i.e. https://github.com/username/project
  - https://itunes.apple.com/app/app-name/id-zzz

or

- [App name](source url): Short description 🔶
